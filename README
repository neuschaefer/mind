          "Mind"

This is a little puzzle game for VT102 terminals and terminal emulators.
It should work fine on almost all Linux systems.

It's called mind because it seems to be similiar to Mastermind, but the game
concept is really taken from a mini game in "Jets 'n' Guns" by Rake in Grass
(http://www.rakeingrass.com/game_jetsnguns.php).
